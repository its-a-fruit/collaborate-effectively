# Team goals
The main goals of this team is to get our users to easily use our product, by focussing on making a simple interface that can be understood by anyone. There should be no magic gestures or key combinations to get things done: we are pragmatic and provide a "what you see is what you get" set of screens.

# Application description
We handle all of the worlds todo lists with ease! Have a personal bucket list? Need a grocery list to share with the fam? Want to have a Kanban backlog with all the bells and wistles? We've got it!

# Topics
Here are some topics to get you started with the way we work in our team. Add the slash command in the comment of this action to discover a new topic. 

* Architecture: `/architecture`
* Monitoring our application (both Dev/Prod): `/monitoring`
* Agile process: `/agile`
* Coding: `/coding`

In the sections below we explain those topics in a bit more detail.

## Architecture
Todo: add architectural overview

## Monitoring
For monitoring we use Splunk for everything. That means anything we add to the logging needs to be handled through our central. Dive into the Splunk

## Agile process
Kanban all the way (todo: needs more explaination!)

## Coding
We heavily use Codespaces for all our development. No more need to be working on getting it all running on your own machine, we host a standard definition machine in the cloud for you! See Codespaces as a light weight container that spins up, instead of a full OS.
